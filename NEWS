PHP CLEARSILVER RELEASE NOTES
=============================

PHP ClearSilver has been bumped from version 0.1 to 0.4 to reflect the
stabilisation of the distribution. It has been used and tested
extensively in house as well as by a number of external users who have
made useful contributions.

The following notable enhancements have been made. Please refer to the
ChangeLog for further details.

- Updated the package to work with PHP 5.3.0

- Exposed more of the ClearSilver API, notably the hdf_read_string(),
  hdf_remove_tree() and hdf_set_node() functions.

- hdf_set_value() has been altered so that all PHP parameters passed
  in as the value argument are converted to their string
  representations. hdf_set_node() should now be used to add HDF
  objects and arrays to an HDF structure.

- Fixed various bugs.

- Improved configuration testing and integration of existing
  ClearSilver installations.

- Improved build system to be more compatible with the PHP PECL
  package structure.

- Updated the documentation
