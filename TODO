BUGS TO SQUASH AND ENHANCEMENTS TO BE MADE

- Expose hdf_obj_top

- Expose hdf_get_attr, hdf_set_attr (See python for implementation
  example)

- Create OO interface (See
  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/swishe/swish_php/swishe.c?rev=1.4
  for example). The intention here would be ease of use, whereas the
  current functional API mirrors the ClearSilver C API fairly closely;
  there are a number of opportunities for simplifying the API using OO
  principles.

- document compact option to hdf_write_string
  
- Check possibility of enhancing ClearSilver C API to provide stream
  (FILE*) equivalents to its functions that use file paths so that PHP
  Streams API can be used in:
  hdf_read_file()
  NEOERR* hdf_read_stream (HDF *hdf, FILE *stream, char *path);
  
  hdf_write_file()
  NEOERR *hdf_write_stream (HDF *hdf, FILE *stream, char *path);

  cs_parse_file()
  NEOERR *cs_parse_stream (CSPARSE *parse, FILE *stream, char *path);

- Check possibility of enhancing ClearSilver C API to provide option
  for creating HDFs in different formats (Pretty, Compact, Dotted) in:
  hdf_write_file()
  NEOERR* hdf_write_file (HDF *hdf, char *path, int format);

  hdf_write_string()
  NEOERR* hdf_write_string (HDF *hdf, char **s, int format);
